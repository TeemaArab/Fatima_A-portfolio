            <p>Over the years, I have seen how technology has revolutionized education, making learning more accessible, engaging, and personalized.
                 As a former TEFL(Teaching English as Foreign Language) instructor with  years of experience, I worked with students of all ages and backgrounds and witnessed firsthand how digital tools 
                 transformed the way people learn.
                  However, I also noticed that this transformation was not inclusive for everyone—many individuals, including seniors and people with special needs, 
                  struggled to navigate technology that was not designed with them in mind. This gap between innovation and accessibility inspired me to transition into software development. 
                I wanted to build applications that empower people, ensuring that technology is not a barrier but a bridge to learning, independence, and everyday tasks.</p>
            <p>My goal as a developer is to create intuitive, inclusive, and user-friendly applications that cater to people of all generations and abilities. 
                I believe that technology should simplify life, not complicate it, and that great design should feel natural for everyone. 
                Too often, I saw individuals struggle with mobile apps that were not built with their needs in mind—whether due to complex interfaces, lack of accessibility features, or unintuitive design.
                 By combining my background in education with my growing expertise in programming,
                 I aim to develop solutions that help people confidently engage with technology, whether for learning, working, or simply navigating the digital world with ease.
