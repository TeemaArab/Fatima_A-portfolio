            <p><strong>Date:</strong> March/12/2025</p>
            <p><strong>Hiring Manager</strong><br>
               PheedLoop <br>
               Toronto, ON</p>
            
            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            
            <p>I am excited to apply for the <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> position at <strong>PheedLoop</strong>. As a senior Computer Programming and Analysis student set to graduate in two months, I have gained hands-on experience in full-stack development through my academic project, <strong>Biz Horizon</strong>. 
                In this project, I developed RESTful APIs, optimized database structures, and built responsive UI components using React,javascript, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. This experience has strengthened my ability to create scalable, user-friendly web applications, aligning well with PheedLoop’s technical stack.</p>
            
            <p>Through BizHorizon, I increased my problem-solving skills by debugging and optimizing application performance, ensuring seamless user interactions.
                 I played a key role in developing the admin dashboard layout, allowing businesses to manage bookings and customer interactions efficiently. 
                 Additionally, I designed and implemented the front-end for customers section, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. One of my major contributions was building the feedback section and order sections, handling both front-end and back-end development to collect, store, and display user reviews seamlessly. 
                 I worked on designing an intuitive user experience while implementing secure authentication and data management. 
                 Additionally, I collaborated with my team to deploy the project efficiently, gaining familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and version control (Git) in the process of  modern software development.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond my technical experience, my role as a Customer Service Representative at Loblaws have equipped me with strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. 
                Managing a social media learning community of 29,000 followers, I developed the ability to engage diverse audiences and explain complex concepts in an accessible way—an essential skill
                 for working in collaborative development teams. My customer service role further refined my ability to troubleshoot challenges quickly and adapt to fast-paced environments.</p>
            
            <p>What excites me most about PheedLoop is the opportunity to work on impactful, innovative solutions in a collaborative environment. 
                I thrive in settings where I can continuously learn, contribute, and grow, and I am eager to bring my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to your team.
                 The chance to build applications that improve user experiences while working with like-minded individuals is exactly what I am looking for in my next step.</p>
            
            <p>I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with PheedLoop’s vision. Thank you for your time—I look forward to your response.</p>
            
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p><strong>Fatima Arab</strong></p>
